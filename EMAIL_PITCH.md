## Version 1: Cold Email to Investors

**Subject:** MedLabLingo — AI that helps patients actually understand their medical documents

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Mukul Ved, and I built MedLabLingo — an AI-powered tool that takes a patient's lab report or discharge instructions and explains it in plain language, in their own language.

**The problem is massive:**
- 36% of U.S. adults can't understand their own medical documents
- Misunderstood discharge instructions cause 20% of hospital readmissions within 30 days — costing the system $26 billion a year
- 25 million Americans with limited English proficiency face even worse outcomes

**What MedLabLingo does:**
A patient uploads their PDF. In under a minute, they get a clear summary, their lab values explained with visual indicators, medication breakdowns, warning signs to watch for, and questions to bring to their next doctor visit — translated into 15 languages with one click. A built-in chatbot lets them ask follow-up questions grounded on their actual results.

**What makes it different:**
- Privacy-first: personal health information is redacted before it ever reaches an AI model. Zero data stored on servers.
- Multi-provider AI (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o-mini) with automatic failover and safety filtering that blocks medical overreach.
- No account needed. No data collection. Works instantly.

The MVP is fully built, tested, and deployed. I'm raising a $500K pre-seed to bring on a clinical advisor, achieve HIPAA compliance, and pilot the B2B hospital integration — where reducing even 1% of readmissions saves a hospital $500K+ per year in CMS penalties.

I've attached a detailed overview. Would you have 20 minutes this week or next to chat?

Best,

## Version 2: Cold Email to Hospital / Health System Innovation Lead

**Subject:** Reducing readmissions by helping patients understand their discharge documents — pilot proposal

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Hospital Name] is known for its commitment to patient outcomes, and I've built something that could directly support that mission.

**MedLabLingo** is an AI tool that takes discharge instructions and lab reports and converts them into plain-language summaries patients can actually understand — including one-click translation into 15 languages.

Here's why it matters for your team:
- **20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days**, often because they didn't understand their discharge instructions
- **CMS penalizes hospitals** up to 3% of Medicare reimbursements for excess readmissions — that's $500K–$2M/year for a mid-size hospital
- Patients with limited English proficiency have **9% higher readmission rates**

**How it works for your workflow:**
1. Patient receives their discharge paperwork (PDF)
2. They upload it to MedLabLingo (or it's integrated into your portal)
3. They instantly get: medication explanations, home care steps, warning signs, follow-up reminders, and questions for their next visit — in their preferred language
4. A print-ready summary can be shared with family or brought to follow-up appointments

**Privacy is built in:** All personal identifiers are stripped before AI processing. No patient data is stored on any server. The tool can run entirely within your infrastructure if needed.

I'd love to run a small pilot with your discharge team — even 50 patients over 30 days would generate meaningful data on comprehension and readmission impact.

Would you be open to a brief call to explore this?

Best,
Mukul Ved

## Version 3: Cold Email to Insurer / Employer Benefits Lead

**Subject:** A member benefit that improves health literacy and reduces downstream costs

---

Hi [Name],

What if your members could actually understand their lab reports?

Right now, most patients receive medical documents full of jargon they can't parse. They either ignore them, Google their results and panic, or call a nurse line for basic questions. All of this leads to worse outcomes and higher costs.

**MedLabLingo** fixes this. A member uploads their lab report or discharge instructions, and in under a minute gets:
- A plain-language summary of what their results mean
- Visual indicators for which values are normal, high, or low
- Medication breakdowns and home care instructions
- Questions to bring to their next doctor visit
- One-click translation into 15 languages (Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, and more)

**Why it matters for [Company Name]:**
- Better-informed members make fewer avoidable ER visits and follow medication plans more consistently
- Reduced call volume to nurse lines for "what does this mean?" questions
- A differentiated benefit that members will actually use and appreciate
- Simple to deploy — web-based, no integration required, no member data stored

Pricing is flexible: per-member-per-month, per-use, or annual license.

I'd be happy to walk you through a live demo. Would 15 minutes work sometime this week?

Best,
Mukul Ved

## Version 4: Short Intro / Warm Referral

**Subject:** Quick intro — AI tool helping patients understand medical documents

---

Hi [Name],

[Referrer name] suggested I reach out.

I built MedLabLingo — a tool where patients upload their lab report or discharge instructions and get a plain-language explanation with translations into 15 languages, all with full privacy protections.

The MVP is live and working. I'm looking for [investors / clinical partners / pilot hospitals / advisors] to help take it to the next stage.

Happy to send a one-pager or jump on a quick call — whatever's easiest.

Thanks,
Mukul Ved
