  "task": "MedLabLingo — latest state (Feb 21): Added context-aware chatbot on results page. NEW: POST /api/chat endpoint (src/app/api/chat/route.ts) — takes messages[] + analysisResult as context, calls gpt-4o-mini strictly grounded on that analysis, applies safetyFilter(), rate-limited, mock mode supported. NEW: AnalysisChat.tsx component — user/AI message bubbles, bounce typing indicator, suggested question chips from questionsForDoctor, auto-scroll, error handling. results/page.tsx updated to render <AnalysisChat result={result} suggestedQuestions={result.questionsForDoctor} />. Also done: README rewritten for public release, Mermaid architecture diagram added, AGENT_RULES.md + next-env.d.ts removed from git, market impact doc written, all pushed to https://github.com/vedmukul/medlablingo (branch main, latest commit 6e657e7).
